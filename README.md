# Digital Advertising Click Prediction Model

## Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning solution to predict whether internet users will click on digital advertisements based on their demographic and behavioral characteristics. Using logistic regression, the model analyzes user engagement patterns to help businesses optimize their advertising strategies and improve campaign ROI.

The predictive model addresses a critical business challenge in digital marketing: identifying high-value prospects who are most likely to engage with advertisements, enabling more targeted and cost-effective advertising campaigns.
